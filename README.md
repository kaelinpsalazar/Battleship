### Written Reflection

Iteration 3 did not provide an interaction pattern. How did you approach designing this iteration? If you did not get to Iteration 3, reflect on how you think you wouldâ€™ve approached the design and problem solving process.

We tried to map out all of the methods we'd need to complete It.3.  We drew upon our knowledge of the gameplay and did our best to map out that logical flow.

If you had one more day to work on this project, what would you work on?

We would use more helper methods.  Organize gameplay methods a little better.  Add more personality.

Describe the pairing techniques you used while working on this project.

LOTS of sync and a little ping pong async.

Describe how feedback was shared over the course of this project.

Actively as one was driving and the other was navigating.
